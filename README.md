### Hi there! 👋
My name is Toms Kristiāns Prūsis and I am an aspiring software developer. Even though, I mainly code in Java, I try to keep my mind sharp and active by learning new languages and revising the ones I already know, constantly improving my knowledge base.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a flight planner API
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code in Ruby with the Rails framework
